🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze how financial news sentiment influences stock price movements. By combining transformer-based NLP (FinBERT), machine learning models, and generative AI (LLMs), the project explores whether investor sentiment reflected in news articles can help predict stock trends and generate investor-friendly summaries.

⚙️ How it works

Data Collection

Stock price data (AAPL, AMZN) from Yahoo Finance

Financial news articles filtered for those companies

Sentiment Analysis

Use FinBERT (finance-trained transformer) to classify news as Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Aggregate sentiment scores daily for each ticker

Stock Prediction

Merge sentiment with historical stock data

Train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost) to predict stock returns or movements

Generative AI Summaries

Use LLMs (Watsonx.ai) to automatically create plain-language investor reports from model outputs

Visualization

Build dashboards (Python / IBM Watson Studio) to show trends, correlations, and forecasts

👉 In short:
The project connects financial news → sentiment → stock prediction → investor summaries → dashboards.
